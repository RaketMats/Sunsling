These are some principles we believe are true  

1. Features, architecture, functions, technology can never be sold. Only use-cases can be sold. (James Coplien)
2. Design is organising the product in it's entirety. (Dieter Rahms)
3. Grids bring peace to chaos. (grud.design)  
4. Constraints, not compromises. (tbd) Constraint help avoid pain of too many options. (grug.design)
5. The basic design cycle is: Make. Test. Cry. Fix. (grug.design)
6. Methods and tools seldom work right of the bat. Teams need to adapt to particular circumstances.
7. Methods and tools are seldom provided togehter with how to work in context of other. Teams need to adapt to all other they use. 
8. Problem understanding and definition is often insufficiently.
9. Practical knowledge is often done insufficiently.
10. Architectural frameworks also work as ontologies. (See e.g. Zachman, Edgy or Enterprise Design Framework, or Archimate also)
11. The attributes of these ontologies and their relationships form the basis for re-framing a problem which is the fundamental move in problem and solution spaces. (See e.g. how elements in Enterprise Design Framework such as Actor, Touchpoint, Operation)
